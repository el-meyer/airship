Improvements as of 20.11.2022:

In general, there are no messages/warnings/errors outputted into the console.
Also no red errors appear in the UI as they are mittigated in the code and 
converted into informative warnings that try to guide the user on "what to do".

 
 1) Default Value Tab:
 - FIXED: when not all default values were selected, pressing the "Reset selection" 
          button was not working.


 2) Scatterplot:
 - FIXED: added messages "no OCs chosen" and "please specify default values first" 
          when OCs are not yet available or default values are not yet chosen

 - FIXED: changing the value of the widget "Choose color parameter" causes
          errors (red colored errors in the UI and in the console)


 3) Distribution tab
 - ISSUE: sometimes the distribution tab is not shown after it was hidden and 
          after a new data set was uploaded. The if/else condition is executed
          properly but the distribution tab is not showing up anymore. Maybe
          it is an issue with shiny.


 4) Data aggregation
 - FIXED: when new data is uploaded and defined output variables 
          via "State last input variable" are not numeric (or cannot be converted into
          numeric) the app is not crashing (no standard deviations and means 
          are defined for characters etc.). An informative warning is given
          
 - FIXED: when replication variable is not an integer variable the app crashes
          (user gets a message that a replication variable must be an integer variable)


 5) Plot tab:
 - IMPROVED: one can also close an animation (new button)
 - IMPROVED: if an animation cannot be created there is no more red errors
             popping in the UI. Instead, there is a message the animation cannot be created
 - FIXED: when error bars were defined and then a new data set was uploaded
          the plot was constantly blocked and it was demanded that lower/upper
          bounds are defined (even if they were defined again!) 
          That was cased by the following code:
            need(!is.null(input$errorvars), "Please define error variables")
          The fix was to use isTruthy instead of "!is.null":
            need(isTruthy(input$errorvars), "Please define error variables")
          This solved the issue since after the second time the widget was used
          it was not NULL anymore but an empty character or something else than 
          NULL.
          
6) Misc:
 - FIXED: No more warning in the R console at app start-up complaining about
          icon("paint-brush"). The icon name "paint-brush" has been changed to
          "paintbrush" in the "fontawesome" package.
- IMPROVED: redundant comments in the code have been removed
- IMPROVED: the output with the "Code for reproduction"" in the plot tab has been
            removed, since there is not yet such functionality
